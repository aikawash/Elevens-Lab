1. The relationship between a deck and a card is that many cards make up a deck. In this assignment, decks are made 
from array lists of cards.
2. There are 6 cards because there are 1 of each rank in each suit.
3. String[] ranks04 = {"Ace","2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "jack", "queen", "king"};
   String[] suits04 = {"Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs"};
   int[] pointValues04 = {11, 12, 13};
   Deck deck04 = new Deck(ranks04, suits04, pointValues04);
   System.out.println(deck04);
   
   for (int i = 0; i < ranks.length; i++) 
            {
                Card someCards = new Card(ranks[i], suits[i], values[i]);
                this.cards.add(someCards);
            }
        this.size = this.cards.size();
